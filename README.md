Ruby scripts that interface with Reddit's public API using <a href="https://github.com/avinashbot/redd">Redd</a>.

Just add a 'creds.yaml' file in the directory that the script is in with your credentials and run the script. The output will be a list of permalinks of the 'saved' content of the configured Reddit account. 

Note that you must first configure your Reddit account to allow programmatic access through the API. For more information, visit: https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps/
